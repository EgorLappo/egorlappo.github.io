title: Hello!
---

I am <abbr title="$pronunciation$">Egor Lappo</abbr>! I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Biology at Stanford University, working with Prof. [Noah Rosenberg](https:/rosenberglab.stanford.edu). 

I am interested in evolution, populations, and culture. In 2022, I have graduated with a B.S with Honors in Mathematics from Stanford. I was advised by [Ciprian Manolescu](https:/stanford.edu/~cm5). 

Apart from research, I am interested in [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/egorlappo), functional programming, [music](https://soundcloud.com/egor-lappo), and video essays on YouTube.

You can take a look at my **[CV](files/cv.pdf)** or my **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)** profile for more information!

## Code

Here are some of my coding projects you might find useful.

 - **[`rustwf`](https://github.com/EgorLappo/rustwf)** is a program to run simulations of Wright-Fisher models that I have written while learning Rust. It is exceptionally simple, but also really fast! 
 - **[`tree_graphics`](https://github.com/EgorLappo/tree_graphics)** is a small Haskell program that draws trees given their Newick encoding. I use it when I need example trees for presentations or papers. 
 - The Python code in the **[`ac_lattices`](https://github.com/EgorLappo/ac_lattices)** repository can be used to compute lattices of ancestral configurations and draw every figure in the "lattice paper" ([arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2111.10456)).
