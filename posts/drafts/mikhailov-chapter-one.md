## The meeting

They say that our city is ancient - from some century. 
All new buildings are located behind the railway, and our side has two- and three-story houses.
Previously, they were the only ones here: behind the railway was the forest and the swamp. 
Then they built a factory and new houses for its workers. Factory of plastic products. 
You must have an old blue bucket or a toy yellow duck floating in the tub. 
It is quite possible that they were made here.

Why bring up childhood memories at all? 
This is a simple and natural way to start a story, as well as to sow the causes that will later grow, to encode the foundations of future problems in naive nostalgic images. 
Childhood images float in the memory like in muddied water, they can be highlighted and adjusted, or vice versa, darkened. 
When someone talks about their first memory, they take out a certain discernible fragment from the dormant mire and form it into a clear sense of the past. Although this feeling may not be there. 
All this is done to complete the past. 
It was not, and now here it is. 
Now this is an equally full-fledged past than the one that truly "was."

So, my first memory. New Year's Eve celebration, I'm two and a half years old.

Mom was running from the room to the kitchen and back, setting the table. My father was talking with friends, laughing.
My father looked at me, winked and said something. 
This memory is colored in a certain color. 
Almost everything there is maroon, except for the sun rays - they are light. 
Maybe there were such string lights on the Christmas tree, with their light passing through the whole room, or maybe the TV flickered like that. 
We had a Rubin color TV, and a soft ringing was coming from it. 
I can’t remember what kind of friends my father had --- obviously I never saw them again. 
I remember only one phrase from there: my mother came into the room and said that today she had a haircut like Allochka's.

Of course, this is not the first memory, but one of. 
Then there's a dark pit in my memory. 
Although this is not a pit at all, but the feeling of the night, as if we are all sleeping and having plotless dreams. 
The next clear memory is that I am four years old, closer to five.
 
I lived together with my mother. About once a month, a gloomy man came to us and, standing in the doorway, handed an envelope to my mother. 
Mom nodded to him, and then he would leave. 
I couldn’t make out his face at all, each time I saw only a silhouette, and even after his arrival, a pungent smell was still remaining near the door. 
We definitely had enough money, because my mother did not work. 
Days and months all passed in the same way, we did not go anywhere except the countryside, we lived in the same apartment, walked around the city, watched TV. 
Even in the countryside we could not stay for a long time.
For some reason, almost immediately upon arrival, my mother would quarrel with her parents, my grandparents, and we would pack our things and leave. 
What is the point of traveling all day and night on the train to stay for a couple of hours and go back? 
When I asked why we were leaving so quickly, my mother explained that she did not like being taught how to live.

We had a lot of books, I constantly leafed through them, stared at the pictures. 
By the way, I don’t remember how my mother taught me to read. 
It seems that I learned it myself and somehow immediately.
Although, how can this be? 
At the age of six, my mother bought a turntable and a bunch of records. 
It turned out to be even more interesting than the movies: the records could be re-listened to as many times as I wanted. 
Occasionally, my grandmother visited us. She let my mother go for a couple of days and sat with me. 
She didn’t really say anything, she sat and watched me listen to records and leaf through books, cooked food, let me out into the yard to play and then called from the window for me to come back.

Another year passed, and we got a VCR with foreign films. 
There were not so many cassettes: just several action films and comedies. 
I started going to school, and my mother asked me not to tell anyone there what we have at home, and not to say anything at all about our family. 
But what could I say? 
For some reason, I felt uncomfortable asking where my father was. 
I felt that this was a taboo question, just like the question about that gloomy man who constantly comes and holds out envelopes. 
All these memories are colored ashen that sometimes tured into silver. 
They smell of old furniture, dust, and the hum of a heating TV screen.

I was bored at school. 
Every day I went there and did not understand why. I would get up and begin to mentally count the hours until it would all end, until I could return home and do something interesting. 
I didn't really talk to anyone at school. 
Almost all of them were children of factory workers. 
Everyone had heaps of the same plastic toys. 
All these memories of school are like a monotonous trip to the countryside. Nothing happens, thoughts are spinning, you sit and swing on a half-dead swing, you go to a meaningless place from which you will have to leave tomorrow.

Once there was a special event. 
Everyone talked about their parents, who works where. The children talked about how they went to the factory and watched how products are made. 
I sat there, afraid that it's going to be my turn and that I would need to say something similar. 
About plastic, factory workshops, installations. 
When it was my turn, I boldly said that my father works as an engineer, and my mother as an accountant. 
I repeated this after one of my classmates. 
Calmly, with the right intonation. 
And there were no further questions.

Everything changed on one sunny day. 
It was unusually sunny, the light rays passed through everything visible, they penetrated into the room, seeping through the curtains, they even rang in my ears. 
There was a knock on the door. 
I approached it, opened without asking who was there. 
And there was my father. 
His eyes were wet in an instant, he knelt down and hugged me. 
I immediately recognized him, I was not afraid, I did not run away. 
Mom came up, saw us. She also cried, knelt down, and hugged us with him. 
We stood like that for a few minutes without saying anything. 
Then my father laughed, winked at me, and said that everything would be different now.

This is the brightest day of childhood memories. 
He has a bright color. Not caustic, but a delicate color.
And the music --- light bells.

A few days later, my father's friends came with their wives. 
My mother set a large table and everyone sat down. 
I sat down not at the table, but on the carpet next to it, and began sorting through the records near the player. 
That gloomy man who came to us now was here with a guitar. 
For the first time I was able to see him clearly. 
He raised his glass, said: "For freedom", drank it, and then sang a song I didn't know. 
It wasn't either from the records or from the TV. 
My father looked at me and smiled. 
Every time I am remembering that time, he always looks cheerful. 
He constantly jokes, laughs, rejoices at who knows what. 
He has a thin and expressive face, I think it probably was handsome. 
And then. 
Father laughed, saying that he was fed up with all this blatnyak [prison songs] and suggesting that we listen to something relevant. 
I silently put on the "Zodiac" record, with the aliens on the cover. 
My father looked approvingly, approached me and said: “He understands, but you don’t, now everything is different.” 
And indeed, everything became different, my mother changed, we began to live not as before, not viscous and gloomy, but as if "Zodiac" was playing all the time.

Father said that we would go to sanatoriums. 
Let's have a rest, look at the sea. 
Everything happened much faster than expected. My mother called the school, said that I was ill, we packed our things, jumped first on the train, then on the train, and the next day we were already at the first sanatorium.

The spring sea impressed me. 
It seemed to be whispering incomprehensible words and humming a melody. 
And it is better not to listen, otherwise you will want to enter it.
Most likely it is infinite, it never ends, merging with the sky.

In the evening we found ourselves in the company of some other vacationers, in a spacious dining room. 
Our new acquaintances talked about their lives and impressions from the rest. 
The father talked about himself. 
And what did he say? 
I even twitched slightly, because it seemed that he overheard my story at that school event. 
He works at the factory as an engineer, and my mother is an accountant, we received a ticket and immediately came here to improve our health.

At night, my mother woke me up. 
My father was not in the room. 
She took my hands, 
pulled me to her and asked me to remain calm, no matter what happened.
I was scared. 
She saw that I am frightened and laughed. 
Then she said that there would be nothing scary. 
She did not want to tell me anything in advance, I just needed to behave naturally and be silent. 
We went down the stairs, towards the dining room, then turned the corner, went down one more floor. 
Father was sitting there with the people, the same people with whom we dined together. 
They were playing cards. 
Mom confidently walked towards them, and when she approached, she screamed at my father. 
Everyone was confused. 
Mom cried and said that he promised not to play anymore, that we were already in big debts and that he could at least think about the child. 
I stood and watched what was happening, not knowing how to react. 
Then, my mother grabbed my hand, turned around and quickly walked back. 
We returned to our room and mom said I was good. 
Soon, my father appeared and hurriedly packed our things. We called a taxi, got into the car, and drove off. 
I was carsick, wanted to throw up, all these nighttime events merged with the view from the window and the swaying. 
My mother asked the driver to stop and we got out on the side of the road in the middle of an empty road. 
I caught my breath and we drove on.
