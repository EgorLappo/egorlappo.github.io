Recently I have decided to go through my old film scans from the time I was just starting with film photography as a hobby. Sadly, I realized that only a couple shots are actually good. 

The first good photo was shot in Winter of 2016 on my trusty Olympus OM-2n with a 50mm f/1.8 lens with CineStill 800T. I decided to leave the colors as-is, without correcting white balance, because it has better vibes this way.

The next one was taken I just bought my Bronica SQ-A with olympiad prize money. I used a 65mm f/4 lens and HP5+ to take it. The frozen lake on the photo is in the central park in Tula, my hometown.

No one in Tula **really** knew how to process 120 color film, which resulted in several ruined rolls. I scanned them anyway and the results were one of the best photos I've ever taken.

Both of these are Kodak Ektar 100 with the same Bronica setup.

As a bonus, here is the best film street photo that I've ever taken.
